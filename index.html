                <h3>The problem</h3>
            <p>Statistics tell us that in Nigeria, 1 in 4 girls by the time she reaches 18 would have experienced at least <br>
                one form of sexual assualt. Half of Nigeria's female population is under the age of 24; in other words, <br>
            100,000 girls endure various forms of sexual assault daily. These girls are assaulted by family members, religious leaders, <br>
                members of the armed forces, teachers etc. The African culture instigates silence on the matter and perpetrators <br>
            go unpunished while the victims suffer stigmatisation. <br>
                The cycle must be broken.</p>
